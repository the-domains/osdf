The arguments here
really fail to take into account their own findings.

The most strikingly
obvious being:

"Using the
equation, Dr Grimes calculated that hoax moon landings would have
been revealed in 3 years 8 months, a climate change fraud in 3 years
9 months, a vaccination conspiracy in 3 years 2 months, and a
suppressed Cancer cure in 3 years 3 months. In simple terms, any one
of the four conspiracies would have been exposed long before now."

REALLY ? Only 3
years 9 months for climate change fraud? Because from where I am
standing, it took 30 godamn years.

This is is pretty
high order hubris that has no capacity to evaluate the effects of
propaganda, also known as "damage control" in the marketing
sense. Used very often by those with privilege or criminality to hide
their deeds with the rights of a capitalist. However the real culprit
here is the inability to understand the nature of the public
consciousness.
