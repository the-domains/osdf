Trustwave makes some pretty good points here, but this title is hilariously ironic.  
First, there are a lot of references to the low odds of winning the 
lottery, and thus declaring it a fool's errand to play, which to SOME 
degree it is.  
However this completely overlooks the fact that people do, indeed, win the lottery.  
While only too happy to slap down the w" 1-in-292.2 million" odd's 
while conveniently forgetting that, 3 people won. The REAL story here, 
is that, crazy shit h

appens, and you 
shouldn't skimp on security measures just because "it probably won't 
happen". Probably won't ? Have you ever seen the list of "past winners" 
on the lottery website ? are we to assume that this is all a hoax to 
dupe people into playing the lottery ?

So yes, there is much to be 
said about the illusion of control that can spawn sentances like "peers 
shouldn't play the lotto. If they do, he argued, they tacitly admit to 
being poor at risk analysis" which implies that said security researcher
belives security is like a math equation and does not require any 
creativity or uncertainty. If you think security is just a matter of 
math, you don't understand the human element.
